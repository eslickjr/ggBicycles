# myPortfolio
  
  ## Description
  This a portfolio that displays my active projects, resume, contact information, and a brief about statement for me. I built this so people could access and see my work through my portfolio instead of having to track me through github.

  ## Installation
  They would need to download the file and type npm install and then type npm run dev. This would allow them to access the localhost or they could use the website https://flahlesportfolio.netlify.app/ to access my active website.
  ## Usage
  You can just follow the links in the navbar to view my portfolio, about, contact, or resume, and retreive the desired information. If on the portfolio page, you can click view project to be directed to that git repository. You can use the contact page to reach out to me. My github is linked in the footer.
