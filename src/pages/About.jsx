                &emsp; &emsp; I am a full stack developer with a background in project management and customer service. I have a passion for problem solving and learning new technologies. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina Charlotte Coding Bootcamp and I am excited to start my career in web development. I partake in golf and Fortnite. I am very good at Fortnite and pretty mediocre at golf. I have a dog, cat, son, fiance, and soon to be daughter. I am a busy guy but I love what I do and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
